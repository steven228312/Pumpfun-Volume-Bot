A sophisticated Solana-based trading bot designed for automated volume trading on Pump.fun tokens. This bot implements advanced trading strategies using multiple distributed wallets to create trading volume and execute buy/sell operations with configurable intervals and percentages.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Wallet Distribution**: Automatically distributes SOL across multiple wallets for decentralized trading
- **Configurable Trading Parameters**: Customizable buy/sell intervals, percentages, and amounts
- **Jito MEV Protection**: Optional Jito integration for enhanced transaction execution and MEV protection
- **Smart Pool State Management**: Real-time monitoring of token pool states for optimal trading decisions
- **Automated Volume Generation**: Continuous buy/sell cycles to maintain trading volume
- **Raydium SDK Integration**: Leverages Raydium for efficient token swaps and liquidity operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with Pino for monitoring and debugging
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The bot is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Engine** (`src/index.ts`): Main trading logic and wallet distribution
- **Executors** (`src/executor/`): Transaction execution handlers (Legacy and Jito)
- **Utilities** (`src/utils/`): Helper functions, logging, and data management
- **Configuration** (`src/config/`): Environment-based configuration management

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- TypeScript 5.8+
- Solana CLI tools
- Active Solana wallet with SOL balance
- Access to Solana RPC endpoints

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steven228312/Pumpfun-Volume-Bot.git
   cd Pumpfun-Volume-Bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   # Wallet Configuration
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
   
   # Solana RPC Configuration
   RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   
   # Trading Parameters
   TOKEN_MINT=your_token_mint_address
   BUY_LOWER_PERCENT=10
   BUY_UPPER_PERCENT=30
   BUY_INTERVAL_MIN=30
   BUY_INTERVAL_MAX=120
   SELL_INTERVAL_MIN=60
   SELL_INTERVAL_MAX=300
   
   # Wallet Distribution
   DISTRIBUTE_WALLET_NUM=5
   
   # Jito Configuration (Optional)
   JITO_MODE=false
   JITO_FEE=0.001
   
   # Trading Configuration
   SLIPPAGE=1.0
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Trading Parameters

- **BUY_LOWER_PERCENT**: Minimum percentage of wallet balance to use for buying
- **BUY_UPPER_PERCENT**: Maximum percentage of wallet balance to use for buying
- **BUY_INTERVAL_MIN/MAX**: Random range for wait time between buy operations (seconds)
- **SELL_INTERVAL_MIN/MAX**: Random range for wait time between sell operations (seconds)
- **DISTRIBUTE_WALLET_NUM**: Number of wallets to distribute SOL across

### Jito MEV Protection

When `JITO_MODE` is enabled, the bot uses Jito's block engine for:
- Enhanced transaction ordering
- MEV protection
- Improved transaction success rates
- Priority fee distribution

## üöÄ Usage

### Development Mode

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npm run build

# Run with ts-node
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

### Production Mode

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the compiled JavaScript
node dist/index.js
```

## üìä How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The bot starts by checking the main wallet's SOL balance
2. **Distribution**: SOL is distributed across multiple wallets based on `DISTRIBUTE_WALLET_NUM`
3. **Trading Cycle**: Each wallet executes a continuous trading cycle:
   - **Buy Phase**: Purchases tokens using a random percentage of available SOL
   - **Wait Period**: Random interval between buy and sell operations
   - **Sell Phase**: Sells all acquired tokens back to SOL
   - **Recovery**: Transfers remaining SOL back to continue the cycle

4. **Volume Generation**: The continuous buy/sell cycles create trading volume for the target token

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Trading Strategies

The modular architecture allows easy addition of new trading strategies:

```typescript
// src/executor/custom-strategy.ts
export const executeCustomStrategy = async (
  wallet: Keypair,
  tokenMint: PublicKey,
  connection: Connection
) => {
  // Implement your custom trading logic
};
```

### Modifying Pool State Logic

Customize how the bot interacts with token pools:

```typescript
// src/utils/custom-pool.ts
export const getCustomPoolState = async (
  tokenMint: PublicKey,
  connection: Connection
) => {
  // Implement custom pool state logic
};
```

## üìù Logging

The bot uses Pino for structured logging with the following features:

- **Transaction Logging**: All buy/sell operations are logged with transaction signatures
- **Balance Monitoring**: Real-time wallet balance tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging with stack traces
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing information for all operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Risk Management**: This bot is designed for volume generation and may result in trading losses
- **Gas Fees**: Continuous trading incurs significant transaction fees
- **Market Impact**: Large volume operations may affect token prices
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local trading regulations
- **Private Key Security**: Never expose private keys in public repositories

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Use dedicated RPC endpoints for better performance
- Monitor wallet balances to prevent insufficient funds
- Adjust trading intervals based on network congestion
- Consider using Jito mode for high-frequency trading

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **General Questions**

**Q: What is Pump.fun Volume Bot?**
A: Pump.fun Volume Bot is an automated Solana trading bot designed to create trading volume for tokens on the Pump.fun platform using multiple distributed wallets and sophisticated trading strategies.

**Q: Is this bot safe to use?**
A: While the bot is well-tested, cryptocurrency trading involves inherent risks. Always start with small amounts and monitor the bot's performance closely.

**Q: Do I need programming knowledge to use this bot?**
A: Basic knowledge of Solana wallets and environment configuration is required. The bot is designed to be user-friendly but requires proper setup.

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: What happens if the bot encounters an error?**
A: The bot includes comprehensive error handling and will retry failed transactions up to 10 times before moving to the next operation.

**Q: Can I modify the trading strategy?**
A: Yes! The bot is built with a modular architecture that allows easy customization of trading strategies, intervals, and parameters.

**Q: How does the Jito integration work?**
A: Jito mode provides MEV protection and enhanced transaction ordering by using Jito's block engine, improving success rates for high-frequency trading.

**Q: What if my wallet runs out of SOL?**
A: The bot automatically checks balances and will stop operations if insufficient funds are detected, preventing failed transactions.

### **Configuration Questions**

**Q: How do I determine the optimal trading intervals?**
A: Start with conservative intervals (30-120 seconds for buys, 60-300 seconds for sells) and adjust based on network congestion and token volatility.

**Q: What's the recommended number of distribution wallets?**
A: 5-10 wallets is typically optimal. Too few reduces volume distribution, too many increases complexity and gas costs.

**Q: How do I calculate the right buy percentages?**
A: Consider your risk tolerance: 10-30% is conservative, 30-50% is moderate, 50%+ is aggressive. Always leave buffer for gas fees.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Q: The bot isn't executing trades. What should I check?**
A: Verify your RPC endpoint, wallet balance, private key format, and token mint address. Check the logs for specific error messages.

**Q: Transactions are failing. How can I fix this?**
A: Ensure sufficient SOL balance, check network congestion, verify slippage settings, and consider enabling Jito mode for better success rates.

**Q: How can I monitor the bot's performance?**
A: The bot provides comprehensive logging with Pino. Monitor transaction signatures, balance changes, and error logs for insights.
